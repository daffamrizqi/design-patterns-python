- Factory design pattern allows us to to choose during runtime what particular instance 
  we want to create
- ex:
  - We have an abstract Person interface and then we wanna have student and teacher 
  - But we dont wanna decide in the code which one we want to instantiate (make it dynamic)


abc (abstract base classes) module in python:
- Is a tool for creating abstract base classes (ABCs) and abstract methods
- An abstract base class CANNOT BE INSTANTIATED and serves as A BASE CLASS for
  one or more derived 
- Often used when using facotry pattern(creational patter) in python to make the interface
- Abc are used to define a set of methods that must be implemented by any CONCRETE
  (i.e, not abstract) subclass
- This allows you to create a common interface for a group of related classes and ensures 
  that certain methods are implemented in all of them

Abstract method:
- Is a method that is declared in an abstract base class, but DOES NOT HAVE AN IMPLEMENTATION
- Abstract method are meant to be implemented by CONCRETE SUBCLASSES, and they provide a way
  to specify that a subclass must implement certain functionality


@staticmethod:
- A staticmethod in python is a method that BELONGS TO A CLASS rather than an instance of
  of the class
- It is a method that is SHARED by ALL INSTANCES OF A CLASS, and it does not HAVE ACCESS
  to THE INSTANCE ITSELF
