Interface Overview:
- At high level, an interface acts as BLUEPRINT for designing classes
- Like classes, interfaces define methods
- Unlike classes, these methods are abstract
- An abstract method is one that the interface simply defines. It doesn't implement the methods
- This is done by classes, which then IMPLEMENT the interface and give CONCRETE MEANING
  to the interface's abstract methods

Informal Interfaces:
- In certain circumstances, you may not need the strict rules
  of formal python interface.
- Python dynamic nature allows you to implement an INFORMAL INTERFACE
- An informal python interface is a class that defines methods 
  that can be overriden, but there is no strict enforcement
