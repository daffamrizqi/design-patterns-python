perspective of a data engineer who needs to extract text from

You'll create an informal interface that defines methods that will be in both the
pdfParser and EmlParser concrete classes

methods are defined but not implemented. The implementation will occur once you create

So far you've defined concrete implementation of the InformalPythoninterface.
However, note that EmlParser fails to properly define .extract_text().
If you were to check whether EmlParser implements InformalParserInterface, then youâ€™d get the following result
