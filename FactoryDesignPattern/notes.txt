Overview:
- When delveloping code, you may instantiate objects direcly in method or in classes
- you may want to add extra abstraction between the creation of the objects and where it
  is used in your project
- You can use Factory Pattern (Creational Pattern) to add extra abstraction
- Adding extra abstraction will also allow you to dinamically choose classes to instantiate
  based on some kind of logic


Terminology:
- CONCRETE CREATOR:
  + the client application, class or method that calls the Creator (Factory method)
- PRODUCT INTERFACE:
  + The interface describing the attributes and methods that the Factory will require
    in order to create the final product/object
- CREATOR:
  + The Factory class. Declares the Factory method that will return object requested from it
- CONCRETE PRODUCT:
  + The object returned from the factory. The object implmements the product interface
